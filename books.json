    "summary":"Fahrenheit 451 is a dystopian novel by American writer Ray Bradbury, first published in 1953. Often regarded as one of his best works,[4] the novel presents a future American society where books are outlawed and "firemen" burn any that are found.[5] The book's tagline explains the title: "Fahrenheit 451 â€“ the temperature at which book paper catches fire, and burns..." The lead character, Guy Montag, is a fireman who becomes disillusioned with his role of censoring literature and destroying knowledge, eventually quitting his job and committing himself to the preservation of literary and cultural writings."

      "firstReview":"Honestly one of the best books that I have read for a
      school project. Bradbury is a very smart man for his words and choice
      in books, he did somewhat actually predict many things that are now here
      without knowing that they'll be here, he predicted that
      earbuds/headphones/seashell phones were going to be here in the future
      along with other things. This book gives everyone a thought about how
      books can have a huge impact on us if we never read a book and decide to
      learn about society itself.",
      "secondReview":"I read this book for a school essay and project which I
      wasn't necessarily eccentric about but I read the book anyways. The book
      didn't reach a full climax till the ending part which clicks together all
      of the information you learn in the previous two parts. I've learned to
      fall in love with most of the characters and learn how to reflect on them
      within your daily life. This book has taught me so much more such as the
      preservation of knowledge and how it helps us.",
      "thirdReview":"The books wonderful, the message behind it is clear.
      The imagery and theme were amazing. A lot of younger people who read the
      book talk about it being boring and stale. But, if you actually know how
      to process and analyze a text, it becomes one of the books. I love how
      Bradbury predicted Earbuds, Cell phones, flat screen TVs and the way
      society reacts to the progression of technology. So, it's a great read
      if you're willing to actually read it."

    "coverImage":"img/The-Stranger.jpg",
    "summary":"The Stranger is a 1942 novel by French author Albert Camus.
    Its theme and outlook are often cited as examples of Camus's philosophy of
    the absurd and existentialism, though Camus personally rejected the latter
    label."
    "reviews":
    [
      "firstReview":"The stranger draws on existential themes and helps the
      reader understand them in a meaningful and interesting way. This book is
      Phenomenal I normally hate reading however this was the first book to
      really engage me with a character I believe to be far more interesting
      than most simply because of his unique morals and alienation from society",
      "secondReview":"Very thought provoking book. I sat down and read this in
      one sitting and think about if very often. I like the idea of a man that
      doesn't worry himself over things that unnecessary in life. I personally
      envy his apathy when it comes to relationships, death, and other peoples
      opinions.",
      "thirdReview":"Alienation and quest for identity is the prominent aspects
      of The Stranger.Camus's philosophy of existentialism is the important part
      of the novel. The novel presents the character which doesn't find himself
      in the society and its norms. It challenges the social setup."

  "summary":"1984 is a dystopian novella by George Orwell published in 1949,
  which follows the life of Winston Smith, a low ranking member of 'the Party',
  who is frustrated by the omnipresent eyes of the party, and its ominous ruler
  Big Brother. 'Big Brother' controls every aspect of people's lives."
  "reviews":
  [
    "firstReview":"1984 is a grim tale telling us about the consequences that we
     may face if a totalitarian state happens to come in power and grew
     omnipotent. It is a terrifying read almost horror-like and thus also very
    effective on the minds of the reader. A lot of respect for George Orwell for
    establishing such a well-realized and detailed world, he truly is a
    visionary in that sense. It is a novel that everyone should read at least
    once!",
    "secondReview":"One of the best books ever written in the history of mankind. It's very thought provoking for it to be written in '49 and talk about the society in '84. Even though it's not meant to be a horror story, it definitely conveys the same emotions unto you. The story is gripping, suspenseful. The last few chapters are really intense. They make you think how far politics has come.

I give this book 10/10. Definitely a classic masterpiece.",
    "thirdReview":"This book is really fascinating. It shows what will happen if the people allow the government to get too powerful and controlling. 1984 is really suspenseful and leaves you begging to read more. It kept me on my toes the whole time. Everyone should read this novel."
